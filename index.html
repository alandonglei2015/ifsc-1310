<h3>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h3>
<p>For my Dragon Project I showed the original web design to my friend GuLei. GuLei gave me back the feedback, suggesting it needs a modern design, because that’s what the company SpaceX is about. He also suggested that I put a contact form on the frequently asked questions tab. So for the revision, I used lightbox technique, and I also used some css animations to symbolize the orb’s movements since it’s about a company in space. I also made sure the images are very big and as background for the web, give it a very modernized style. I really enjoyed the overall learning experiences of this class, I wish this class is face to face in class, so it can be more fun. I learned from having no idea how a modern website works, to able to put out a small website containing a few pages. I would say I had very successful learning experiences in this class. During this project, I learned how properly applying section IDs and naming tags techniques can save tons of time for a web design, and I also learned how to do simple CSS animations using css. If I can start over on this project, I would create a contact form on the footer of the web instead of on a separated tab, for the sake of functionality, it would be more user friendly. </p>
<h3>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h3>
<p>I think progeressive enhancement is a development approach, it's how developers approach building the web. As the article Understanding Progessive Enhancement pointed out, the author compared it to Peanut M&M, where content as peanut, presentation is the CSS, and candy shell would be the JS of modern web development. I’ve also read the article What is Progressive Enhancement and Why Should You care? https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/what-is-progressive-enhancement-and-why-should-you-care It also compared progressive enhancement as cake, over all I think graceful degradation is need it, I see it as a goal in the future, we use progressive enhancement the tool to build towards that goal, I personally like the idea and the approach of progressiv enhancement, because it let people to focus on what they are looking for, it also letting the developer focusing on what they are talented at. Myself for example, I’m not very good at css in terms of making the page look nice and smooth, but in JS I can focus on the functionality of the website. Which i have no problem understanding it.</p>
